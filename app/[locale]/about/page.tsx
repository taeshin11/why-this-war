            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Why This War was built on the conviction that access to timely, accurate conflict intelligence should not be limited to governments, think tanks, or expensive subscription services. We believe that journalists, researchers, policy analysts, students, and engaged citizens deserve access to quality information to understand the world&apos;s most pressing security challenges.</p>
            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">In a world where armed conflicts shape economies, displace populations, and determine the course of history, we are committed to making conflict data accessible, transparent, and useful for everyone.</p>

            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Why This War provides in-depth explainers on the historical causes, geopolitical factors, and root issues behind ongoing wars worldwide. Our platform aggregates, verifies, and presents data in a format designed for clarity and usability.</p>
            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">We cover active conflicts across multiple regions, providing visualizations, timelines, and analysis that contextualizes raw data within broader geopolitical realities.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-4">Data Sources &amp; Methodology</h2>
            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Our data is compiled from: official government reports, United Nations agencies (OCHA, UNHCR, WFP), academic conflict databases (ACLED, SIPRI, Uppsala Conflict Data Program), verified open-source intelligence, and internationally recognized news organizations.</p>
            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">We prioritize source transparency and cross-reference multiple sources. Where sources disagree, we present the range of estimates rather than a single contested figure.</p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 mb-4">Why This Matters</h2>
            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">Conflict data is inherently sensitive. We strive to present information in a factual, non-partisan manner to support informed discussion, humanitarian response, and evidence-based policy. The data we track represents real human lives, and that responsibility guides everything we do.</p>

            <p className="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">Traditional news media covers conflicts reactively. Why This War provides continuous, structured monitoring that persists beyond news cycles. Where newspapers provide narrative, we provide data.</p>
